# GitHub Actions

[Related Decision Record](../decision-records/0011-enforce-continuous-integration-with-github-actions.md)

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is the continuous
integration service to centrally run our workflows to verify codebase integrity
with automated quality assurance and. Furthermore, it is used for time scheduled
workflows to frequently validate the codebase health (e.g. vulnerabilities).

Notice the confusion between "workflows" as higher level naming concept of
composed tasks by the [central workflow orchestrator](./task.md), which are
called by [GitHub Actions "workflows"](../../.github/workflows/) inside remote
environments.

## Referencing by Hashes

For supply chain security, container images and remote actions are fully
referenced by their hash. For convenience, the related version number is added
as comment behind it.

Example:

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2
```

## Manual Cash Versioning

All keys for our caches must be suffixed with a version number. The base
key should be composed by all relevant metadata to increase the likelihood of
a cache hit. The suffix is only for manual bumps for rare occasions, when
a cache hit causes issues. The standard format looks like this:

```yaml
key: some-name-${{ with.important }}-${{ information }}-v1
```

In case of a rare occasion, the suffix will be incremented. Here from `-v1` to
`-v2`.

There might be scenarios of pure manual cache management. In such case only the
manual increment will be used as key, here it would be `v1`.
