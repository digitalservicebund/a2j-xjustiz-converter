/**
 * Improved version of {@link Intl.Segmenter.prototype.segment} to properly
 * address binary diacritic clustering.
 *
 * The function can be used to work with the graphemes ("characters") in
 * a linguistic way. This is for example critical when working with regular
 * expressions on the unit of a grapheme (read: test by character, not full
 * string) where binary diacritics play a role (e.g. for DIN 91379).
 *
 * There are unary and binary diacritics. Unary ones combine with a single
 * preceding base letter into a grapheme (e.g. "À" or "ç"). Multiple unary
 * diacritics can also be merged to a shared base letter into a single grapheme
 * (e.g. "R̥̄" or "L̥̄"). Binary diacritics apply to two base letters on their left
 * and right as a single grapheme (e.g. "K͟H" or "T͡s").
 * Unicode treats binary diacritics as unary ones, splitting an actual linguistic
 * grapheme of a single phoneme unit into two clusters. For example, the grapheme
 * "K͟H" (`'\u004B\u035F\u0048'`) becomes "wrongly" split into two clusters of "K͟"
 * and "H" (`['\u004B\u035F', '\u0048']`).
